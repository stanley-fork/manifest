"manifest": patch
---

Fix the "check your dashboard" links that Manifest embeds in `[🦚 Manifest] …` friendly error messages returned by the OpenAI-compatible proxy. Auth errors (missing / empty / invalid / expired / unrecognized key) used to emit `${baseUrl}/routing`, which 404'd — that path does not exist in the frontend router. They now point at the Workspace landing page. Agent-scoped errors used to drop the user on the agent Overview page; they now deep-link to the section that actually fixes the problem — "No API key set for X" and "Manifest is connected successfully, connect a provider" go to `/agents/:name/routing`, and "Usage limit hit" goes to `/agents/:name/limits`.
