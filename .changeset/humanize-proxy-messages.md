"manifest": patch
---

Rewrite the `[🦚 Manifest] …` friendly error messages the proxy sends back as chat completions so they read less like a system alert and more like a note from a person. Em dashes are gone, "connected successfully" is gone, "this API key wasn't recognized" becomes "I don't recognize this key", limit messages lead with "You hit your ${metric} limit" instead of the clinical "Usage limit hit:", and the auth-header hint now tells users the exact `Bearer mnfst_<your-key>` format to paste. No behavioural change — same triggers, same URLs, same branching; just different copy.
