Route short greetings to the `simple` tier even when the agent attaches tools. The scorer's short-message fast path was gated on `!hasTools`, so personal AI agents like OpenClaw (which always send a `tools` array) skipped it entirely and fell into full scoring, where session momentum could pull a one-word `hi` up to `complex`. Dropping the gate lets short, non-technical prompts short-circuit to `simple` before momentum kicks in. Short technical prompts like `Debug this function` still fall through to full scoring.
